  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (SUNDIALS)
  does not match the name of the calling package (Sundials).  This can lead
  to problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  FindSundials.cmake:142 (find_package_handle_standard_args)
